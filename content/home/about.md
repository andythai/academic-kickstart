# Biography

I am currently a **Ph.D. student at UC Irvine studying Computer Science**, supervised by [Professor Gopi Meenakshisundaram](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gopi/). 

My research interests include computer vision, computer animation, and the application of machine learning techniques to problems in computer graphics. 

As a UCSD undergraduate, I have previously worked on studies relating to social robotics, animal-robot interaction, and pro-social reciprocity in rodents within [Professor Andrea Chiba's](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/education/neurograd/faculty/Pages/andrea-chiba.aspx) laboratory.
